# Sentiment Classification From Product Reviews 

For instance:
- Review: "I bought both boxed sets, books 1-5.  Really a great series!  Start book 1 three weeks ago and just finished book 5.  Sloane Monroe is a great character and being able to follow her through both private life and her PI life gets a reader very involved!  Although clues may be right in front of the reader, there are twists and turns that keep one guessing until the last page!  These are books you won't be disappointed with."
- Corresponding sentiment: POSITIVE

- Use models consist of: linear SVM, decision tree, naive Bayes and logistic regression for classification task.
- Evaluate models by metrics (mean accuracy and f1-score) and confusion matrix.
- Tunning model with grid search.
